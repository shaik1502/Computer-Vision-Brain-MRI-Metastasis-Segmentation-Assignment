# Computer-Vision-Brain-MRI-Metastasis-Segmentation-Assignment

Overview:
This project involves the implementation and comparison of two advanced convolutional neural network architectures—Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net—for the segmentation of brain metastases in MRI images. The objective is to evaluate the performance of these models in accurately delineating metastases in brain MRI scans. The project will also include the development of a web application to showcase the segmentation results, making it easier for medical professionals to visualize and interact with the model predictions.

Objectives:
Model Development:

Implement the Nested U-Net (or U-Net++) architecture, an extension of the U-Net model, which introduces dense skip connections to improve feature fusion and facilitate better segmentation.
Implement the Attention U-Net architecture, which integrates attention gates into the U-Net framework to focus on relevant regions in the input images, enhancing segmentation performance.
Train and compare the performance of both models on a brain MRI dataset for metastasis segmentation.
Dataset:

Use a publicly available brain MRI dataset with ground truth metastasis segmentation masks. Preprocess the dataset to handle tasks such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model robustness.
Evaluation Metrics:

Evaluate both models using common segmentation metrics such as Dice Coefficient, Intersection over Union (IoU), Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to determine the accuracy of the models.
Comparison:

Compare the Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net architectures in terms of segmentation performance, training time, model complexity, and generalization on unseen data.
Web Application:

Develop a web application using technologies such as Flask or Django for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.
The web app will allow users (e.g., radiologists) to upload brain MRI scans and visualize the segmentation results generated by the trained models. The application will display a side-by-side comparison of the original MRI, the metastasis ground truth, and the predicted segmentation mask from the models.
Technical Details:
1. Nested U-Net Architecture:
Architecture Description: Nested U-Net (also called U-Net++) is an enhancement of the original U-Net architecture. It introduces dense skip pathways, which allow features to be transmitted not only from the same resolution level but also across different levels. This enhances feature propagation and reuse, helping the model to learn finer details in complex segmentation tasks.
Key Advantages:
Dense connections between encoder and decoder blocks.
Better feature fusion at different levels of abstraction.
Improves small structure segmentation, which is critical for detecting metastases.
2. Attention U-Net Architecture:
Architecture Description: Attention U-Net adds attention gates to the U-Net model. These gates enable the model to focus on relevant parts of the image, reducing the influence of irrelevant regions and improving segmentation performance in the presence of noisy or complex backgrounds.
Key Advantages:
Focuses on salient features using attention mechanisms.
Better for segmenting objects with complex and variable shapes like metastases.
Reduces computational complexity by concentrating only on informative regions.
3. Data Preprocessing:
MRI images will be preprocessed with steps such as:
Resizing: Ensuring all input images have the same dimensions for uniform model input.
Normalization: Scaling pixel values to a range that improves convergence during training.
Augmentation: Using techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance model robustness and generalization.
4. Training and Optimization:
Both models will be trained using a dataset of brain MRI scans with annotated metastases.
Optimization Techniques:
Adam Optimizer for faster convergence.
Learning rate scheduling to optimize training performance.
Data augmentation during training to improve generalization.
Loss Function: The Dice loss function will be used to handle class imbalance and improve segmentation accuracy, as brain metastases are often small and sparsely located.
5. Evaluation:
Both models will be evaluated on a test set using:
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC): Measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth.
IoU (Jaccard Index): Quantifies the intersection between predicted and true segments.
Precision and Recall: Analyze how many true positive metastasis regions are segmented vs. how many are missed.
F1 Score: A balance between precision and recall.
6. Web Application Development:
The web app will be built using a Python web framework such as Flask or Django.
Users can upload brain MRI images, which will be processed by the models to generate metastasis segmentation.
The app will display the input image, ground truth (if available), and the predicted mask from both the Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net models.
The app will allow users to toggle between model outputs and visualize performance differences.
Tools & Technologies:
Python (for model implementation and training)
TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning)
Flask/Django (for building the web app)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for front-end development)
Docker (for containerizing the application)
Cloud/Server (e.g., AWS, GCP) for hosting the web application
Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation and model development)
Deliverables:
Trained Models: Two trained models (Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net) for brain MRI metastasis segmentation.
Web Application: A user-friendly web application to upload MRI scans and visualize segmentation results.
Evaluation Report: A comprehensive report comparing the performance of the models, including metrics like Dice, IoU, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Codebase: Clean and well-documented code for model training, evaluation, and web application.
This project will demonstrate proficiency in advanced computer vision techniques for medical imaging, model comparison, and the development of practical AI-powered applications for healthcare.
